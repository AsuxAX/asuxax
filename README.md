## About me
I'm a self-taught programmer who has been learning Python for over 2 years now (started in 2021).
I've made a few small projects on GitHub that I no longer really maintain. I am currently working on a few big projects right now that I plan on releasing this year or next year. One of them is a content-based anime recommendation algorithm.

#### Hobbies
- Watching anime 
- Reading manga
- Programming


#### Goals
- Become a software engineer
- Release the big projects I've been working on
- Getting myself a fluffy cat to pet on a daily basis
